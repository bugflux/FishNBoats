FishNBoats
==========

This is a Distributed Systems course project from 2011.

I can't find the file with the problem specification, but it was something along the lines of:
- There's a 2 dimensional space that is the Ocean
- There are Schools of fish in a breeding zone, where they can't be caught
- There are Fishing companies at the Wharf that go out fishing whenever the fish go ingo the high sea
- There is a limit to how many boats can occupy a square in the high sea
- A Boat cannot catch a fish without help from another Boat from the Company
- Boats have limited capacity, once filled they can return to the Warf or stay to help others
- Fish decide when to end the fishing season by trying to race to the breeding zone (season ends once they all get there)

To launch, simply run the pt.ua.sd.gui.Faina class in the Master branch

The branches are something along the line of:
Master: Threaded solution
Problema02: Distributed solution with custom communication framework
Problema03: Distributed solution with RMI
