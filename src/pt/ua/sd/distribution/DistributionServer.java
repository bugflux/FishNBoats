/**
 * This is the main process for the distributed solution. This server must be
 * running in all machines. There is a manager somewhere who is giving
 * (ordered!) orders to all known machines.
 * 
 * For example, this machine is ordered to start an Ocean Server. The Ocean
 * monitor and OceanServer are started in this machine, in the specified port.
 * The manager also notifies all other machines that the Ocean is set up at this
 * machine's address and at the given port.
 * 
 * 
 * The startups must be ordered.
 * 
 * If this machine is ordered to start a Boat, for example, the Ocean and
 * DirOpers, for example must have been already started! Here or on another
 * machine, otherwise initialization will fail.
